                Tiradentes was a leading member of the colonial Brazilian revolutionary movement known as Inconfidência
                Mineira, whose aim was full independence from Portuguese colonial power and creation of a Brazilian
                republic.

            <p class="tribute">
                When the separatists' plot was uncovered by authorities, Tiradentes was arrested, tried and publicly
                hanged.
            </p>

            <p class="tribute">
                Since the advent of the Brazilian Republic, Tiradentes has been considered a national hero of Brazil and
                patron of the Military Police.
